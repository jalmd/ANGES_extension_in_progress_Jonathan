This directory contains examples of inferring the organization of
ancestral boreoeutherian and amniote genomes. 

To run an analysis of a data set, defined by a parameter file <PARAMETER_FILE>, 

python ../../src/MASTER/anges_CAR.py <PARAMETERS_FILE>
or 
python ../../src/MASTER/anges_CAR_UI.py &
then load the parameters file <PARAMETERS_FILE> and run the script

The data are taken from three sources.

(1) MARKERS_OUANGRAOUA_ET_AL_2011 is a set of unique and universal
markers taken from (Ouangraoua et al., Reconstructing the architecture
of the ancestral amniote genome. Bioinformatics
27(19):2664-2671. 2011).

The species tree SPECIES_TREE_OUANGRAOUA_ET_AL_2011_BOREOEUTHERIAN is
used for reconstucting the ancestral boreoeutherian genome.  The
species tree SPECIES_TREE_OUANGRAOUA_ET_AL_2011_AMNIOTE is used for
reconstucting the ancestral amniote genome.

The boreoeutherian ancestor is inferred using
- the "linear chromosomes with telomeres" model and the heuristic
approach (PARAMETERS_OUANGRAOUA_ET_AL_2011_BOREOEUTHERIAN_TEL_HEUR),
- the "linear chromosomes" model and the spectral seriation
approach (PARAMETERS_OUANGRAOUA_ET_AL_2011_BOREOEUTHERIAN_SERIATION).

The amniote ancestor is inferred using the "linear chromosomes with
telomeres" model and the branch-and-bound approach
(PARAMETERS_OUANGRAOUA_ET_AL_2011_AMNIOTE_TEL_BAB).

(2) MARKERS_GAVRANOVIC_ET_AL_2011 is a set of unique but not universal
markers taken, together with the species tree
SPECIES_TREE_GAVRANOVIC_ET_AL_2011, from (Gavranovic et al., Mapping
ancestral genomes with massive gene loss: a matrix sandwich
problem. Bioinformatics 27:i257-i265, proceedings of ISMB/ECCB
2011). These markers are taken from the amniotes PECAN whole-genome
alignments of Ensembl 58: alignments with occurrences in at least two
species whose evolutionary path contains the ancestral boreoeutherian
and with all occurrences of 50Kb at least have been used as markers.

Being non-universal, these data are analyzed using the spectral
seriation approach, with ACS being corrected with approach 2 (adding
markers spanned by intervals as 1s and markers missing in both species
by Xs). The results are in directory GAVRANOVIC_ET_AL_2011_SERIATION.

(3) MARKERS_MA_ET_AL_2006 is a set of markers that are ingroup-unique
and ingroup-universal, taken from (Ma et al., Reconstructing
Contiguous Regions of an Ancestral Genome. Genome Research 16:
1557-1565. 2006). 

As markers do overlap (see MARKERS_MA_ET_AL_2006_OVERLAPS, obtained by
the command 
python ../../src/MARKERS/MARKERS_check_for_overlaps_markers.py \
       MARKERS_MA_ET_AL_2006 MARKERS_MA_ET_AL_2006_OVERLAPS
) markers are not doubled.

In MA_ET_AL_2006_BOREOEUTHERIAN_HEUR, no correction for missing marker
was applied and the greedy heuristic was used to infer the ancestral
map. In MA_ET_AL_2006_BOREOEUTHERIAN_SERIATION, the missing markers
were added as X's and the spectral seriation approach was used to
infer the ancestral map, with alpha parameter 0.5.
