markers_doubled 0 # 0 = original markers, 1 = doubled markers
markers_unique 2 # 0 = repeated markers allowed, 1 = ingroup unique, 2 = unique
markers_universal 2 # 0 = missing markers allowed, 1 = ingroup universal, 2 = universal
#
## ACS options
#
#acs_pairs  # name of file containing the species pairs to compare
acs_sa 1 # supported adjacencies: 0 = not computed, 1 = computed
acs_ra 0 # reliable adjacencies: 0 = not computed, 1 = computed
acs_sci 1 # strong common intervals: 0 = not computed, 1 = computed
acs_mci 1 # maximal common intervals: 0 = not computed, 1 = computed
