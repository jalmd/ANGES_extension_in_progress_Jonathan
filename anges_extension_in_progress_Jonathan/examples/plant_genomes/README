This directory contains examples of an ancestral genome computation
for the Rice/Brachypodium ancestor, using Sorghum as an outgroup.

To run the three computations, type
python ../../src/MASTER/anges_CAR.py PARAMETERS_MONOCOTS_BAB 
python ../../src/MASTER/anges_CAR.py PARAMETERS_MONOCOTS_TEL_BAB1
python ../../src/MASTER/anges_CAR.py PARAMETERS_MONOCOTS_TEL_BAB2

The three computations use a branch-and-bound approach. The fist one
does not consider telomeric ACS. The two other ones follow the two
different ways to consider telomeric ACS in a branch-and-bound
context.

The files
PLANT_ANCESTOR/CARS/RICE_BRACHY_ANCESTOR_1_PQRTREE
PLANT_ANCESTOR/CARS/RICE_BRACHY_ANCESTOR_2_PQRTREE
PLANT_ANCESTOR/CARS/RICE_BRACHY_ANCESTOR_3_PQRTREE
contains the ordered and oriented blocks of the ancestor from the three computations.

The coordinates of each marker is found in monocots_tree_RB_ancestor
The markers are described in (Murat F, Xu JH, Tannier E, Abrouk M,
Guilhot N, Pont C, Messing J, Salse J (2010) Ancestral grass karyotype
reconstruction unravels new mechanisms of genome shuffling as a source
of plant evolution, Genome Research, vol. 20 pp.1545-1557).

The 12 CARs obtained in
PLANT_ANCESTOR/CARS/RICE_BRACHY_ANCESTOR_1_PQRTREE and
PLANT_ANCESTOR/CARS/RICE_BRACHY_ANCESTOR_2_PQRTREE represent the
ancestors of the 12 Rice chromosomes. There have been some subsequent
local rearrangements in the Rice
lineage. PLANT_ANCESTOR/CARS/RICE_BRACHY_ANCESTOR_3_PQRTREE provides
additional evidence these 12 CARs are indeed 12
proto-chromosomes. This set of three ancestors reconstructed using
three methods illustrate the impact of considering telomeric ACS in
computations.
