This directory contains examples of computing ancestral genomes maps.

fungal_genomes contains data taken from the paper (Gavranovic et al,
Yeast ancestral genome reconstructions: the possibilities of
computational methods II. J. Comput. Biol.  17:1097-1112. 2010).

mammalian_genomes contains data taken from the papers (Ouangraoua et
al., Reconstructing the architecture of the ancestral amniote
genome. Bioinformatics 27(19):2664-2671. 2011) and (Gavranovic et
al., Mapping ancestral genomes with massive gene loss: a matrix
sandwich problem. Bioinformatics 27:i257-i265, proceedings of
ISMB/ECCB 2011).

plant_genomes contains data taken from (Murat F, Xu JH, Tannier E,
Abrouk M, Guilhot N, Pont C, Messing J, Salse J (2010) Ancestral grass
karyotype reconstruction unravels new mechanisms of genome shuffling
as a source of plant evolution, Genome Research, vol. 20 pp.1545-1557).

bacterial_genomes contains data from two clades: yersinia and burkholderia
- Burkholderia blocks are gene families taken from Hogenom 6
(http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/databases/hogenom/acceuil.php), and
filtered to have exactly one gene per species in the ingroups, and
at least one in the outgroups. The species tree is obtained by
PhyML from a concatenate of 80 universal genes.

README files in the different directories contain more details on the
datasets.

RUN_ALL.sh launches the computations of all examples.  TRACE_ALL.txt
contains the trace of running all examples on a bi-processor desktop
computer running Linux as OS (Linux 2.6.38-11-generic #48-Ubuntu),
including running times recorded with the UNIX command time.
