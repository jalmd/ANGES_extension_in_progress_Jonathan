chromosome composed of genes

exons - introns (in between exons) - exons

transcription -> takes that and generates a mRNA

if too large -> filter
if isnt too large -> modify
    remove the overlap


doubling 


marker (i,j)+  marker(h,l)-

tail of marker1 and head of marker1


undoubled markers

doubled markers: why?
    a,b adjacent in the ancestral genome

    a->
    b->
    or
    a->
    b<-
    or
    a<-


    doubling the markers we will have more information about the genomes





loop on species
    loop chromosomes
        order loci along chorjomosomes
    
    
    one long sorted list of loci
    [species1, species2,...]
    each species has chromosomes (start and end)
    loci -> position in the list
